## Code for internal file export from Athena (SQL Query) -
select title, state, country from public_contact limit 50000

## Excel and Sheets formulas used for this project -
- =proper()
- =lower()
- ctrl+shift+down arrow - to select full data set on page to copy to full/main data set
- copy lower title fields, paste â€“ values option to title column (creating the table from the pivot table - for better formatting in report)
- =LEFT(A26,FIND(" at ",A26)-1) - this was used to find all the job titles with company information included, which was then deleted, I also used this for the " a " variation

# Data cleaning functions in Excel & Sheets  
- used column search bar to sort for junk data lines (ex. job title or location with just "---" in the cell)
- Select Data - Data cleanup - trim whitespace
- Select Data - Data cleanup - remove duplicates (for the assembled contact ID # column, this column was deleted once the duplicate rows were deleted - each contact has a unique ID# so a duplicate row was duplicate data)
